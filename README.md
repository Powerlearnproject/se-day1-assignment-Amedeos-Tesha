#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems in a systematic, controlled, and efficient manner.
Software engineering practices help ensure that software systems are robust and perform well under various conditions.
Well-engineered software tends to offer a better user experience, with intuitive interfaces and smooth interactions
Enables creation of software applications and system that power various 
aspects of moden life,

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering as a language in 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in 1970s 
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - creating high-level and detaileed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design and specifications.
Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment -  Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential software development methodology suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as regulatory-compliant systems. It offers predictability and clear documentation but is inflexible to changes.

Agile is an iterative, flexible approach ideal for projects with evolving requirements, like new consumer apps or startups. It emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptability, delivering incremental value and allowing for quick adjustments based on user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
Version Control Systems are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. May be overcomed by regularly engaging with stakeholders to clarify and confirm requirements.
Accumulated shortcuts or practices can make maintenance and future development difficult. May be overcomed by periodically reviewing and improving code quality to address technical debt.
Meeting deadlines while ensuring quality can be difficult, especially under tight schedules. May be overcomed by prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing verifies individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly, catching issues early and improving code quality. Integration Testing checks interactions between integrated modules to identify interface problems and ensure proper data flow. System Testing validates the entire systemâ€™s functionality and performance against requirements, confirming it operates as intended in a real-world environment. Acceptance Testing assesses the software from the end-user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and is ready for deployment. Each type of testing is vital for delivering reliable, functional, and user-friendly software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusing by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Tell me about cars.' Instead of that you can prompt 'Tell me about the history of Mazda as a company of cars.'
The improved prompt is more effective since it gives a clear information about how the Mazda company started and how it is going on.
